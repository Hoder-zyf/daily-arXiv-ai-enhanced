It has\nbeen shown that training market makers (MMs) with adversarial reinforcement\nlearning allows to overcome the risks due to changing market conditions and to\nlead to robust performances. Prior work assumes, however, that MMs keep quoting\nthroughout the trading process, but in practice this is not required, even for\n``registered'' MMs (that only need to satisfy quoting ratios defined by the\nmarket rules). In this paper, we build on this line of work and enrich the\nstrategy space of the MM by allowing to occasionally not quote or provide\nsingle-sided quotes. Towards this end, in addition to the MM agents that\nprovide continuous bid-ask quotes, we have designed two new agents with\nincreasingly richer action spaces. The first has the option to provide bid-ask\nquotes or refuse to quote. The second has the option to provide bid-ask quotes,\nrefuse to quote, or only provide single-sided ask or bid quotes. We employ a\nmodel-driven approach to empirically compare the performance of the\ncontinuously quoting MM with the two agents above in various types of\nadversarial environments. We demonstrate how occasional refusal to provide\nbid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. The quoting ratios of\nwell-trained MMs can basically meet any market requirements, reaching up to\n99.9$\\%$ in some cases."}

An effective solution is\nto approximate the limit-state function with a surrogate model iteratively\nrefined through active learning, thereby reducing the number of expensive\nsimulations.

We introduce a multi-objective optimization\n(MOO) formulation for sample acquisition in reliability analysis, where\nexploration and exploitation are explicit, competing objectives.

These\npipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency\nand raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model\nidentification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model\noutputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that\nuses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First\n(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an\nincoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow\n(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)\nstagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a\nstagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each\nstage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow\nwith clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on\nspecialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream\ntasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying\ndeployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,\nour single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.\n  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach\nshows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data\nscientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection\n(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead."}

Across 13 diverse\nQA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top\ncontextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a\nno-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting\n(\"paraphrase\" or \"expand\") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively.

Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by\nmeasuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric\ncharacterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in\nscenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian\nframework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when\npresented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and\nirrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In\ncomparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive\nbehavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not\nhave a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination\nof open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing\nsycophancy.

Given a natural language query, PowerChain\ndynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware\nfunctions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function\npool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query\npairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with\nboth GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks\noperating on real utility data."}

This study shifts pedagogical expertise from the\nuser's prompt to the LLM's internal architecture. We embed the well-established\nKnowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework into a Multi-Agent System (MAS)\nto act as a sophisticated instructional designer. We tested three systems for\ngenerating secondary Math and Science learning activities: a Single-Agent\nbaseline simulating typical teacher prompts; a role-based MAS where agents work\nsequentially; and a collaborative MAS-CMD where agents co-construct activities\nthrough conquer and merge discussion.

While particular\nattention is given to geographical research, the discussion extends to wider\nacademic contexts. A parallel strand addresses the pedagogical applications of\nGenAI, encompassing course and lesson design, teaching delivery, assessment,\nand feedback, with geography education serving as a case example.\n  Central to the analysis are the ethical, social, and environmental challenges\nposed by GenAI. Issues of bias, intellectual property, governance, and\naccountability are assessed, alongside the ecological footprint of LLMs and\nemerging technological strategies for mitigation. The concluding section\nconsiders near- and long-term futures of GenAI, including scenarios of\nsustained adoption, regulation, and potential decline. By situating GenAI\nwithin both scholarly practice and educational contexts, the study contributes\nto critical debates on its transformative potential and societal\nresponsibilities."}

We\npropose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a\nnovel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual\nmethods.

We train PU-ADKA using simulations on\nPubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and\nreal-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict\nbudget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and\nexperimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for\ncost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in\nthis challenging area."}

We compare their\nrepresentations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI\nand MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess\nthe brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall\nrepresentational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.\nWe show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -\nindependently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.\nIn particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric\nimages reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like\nrepresentations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:\nmodels first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and\nonly align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with\nconsiderably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed\nby both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the\nrepresentations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with\nthe cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least\nmyelination, and slowest timescales.

These limitations hinder the ability\nto capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we\naddress these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648\nJapanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of\nlegal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references\nto legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an\nontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of\nlegal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit\nreasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert\nannotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant\nlegal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and\nretrieval-augmented methods."}

It focuses on the deep\ndisagreements over whether artificial general intelligence (AGI) will prove\ntransformative for human society; a question that is analytically prior to that\nof whether this transformative effect will help or harm humanity. The study\nbegins by distinguishing two fundamental camps in this debate. The first of\nthese can be identified as \"transformationalists,\" who argue that continued AI\ndevelopment will inevitably have a profound effect on society. Opposed to them\nare \"skeptics,\" a more eclectic group united by their disbelief that AI can or\nwill live up to such high expectations. Each camp admits further \"strong\" and\n\"weak\" variants depending on their tolerance for epistemic risk. These stylized\ncontrasts help to identify a set of fundamental questions that shape the camps'\nrespective interpretations of the future of AI. Three questions in particular\nare focused on: the possibility of non-biological intelligence, the appropriate\ntime frame of technological predictions, and the assumed trajectory of\ntechnological development. In highlighting these specific points of\nnon-technical disagreement, this study demonstrates the wide range of different\narguments used to justify either the transformationalist or skeptical position.\nAt the same time, it highlights the strong argumentative burden of the\ntransformationalist position, the way that belief in this position creates\ncompetitive pressures to achieve first-mover advantage, and the need to widen\nthe concept of \"expertise\" in debates surrounding the future development of AI."}

Across 13 diverse\nQA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top\ncontextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a\nno-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting\n(\"paraphrase\" or \"expand\") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively.

Drawing from multiple\ndisciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact\nshould reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters.\nThis interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the\ndesigners and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues.

These variant token sequences are\ncompiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a\nshallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized\nvariant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription.\nThe evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces\nbiased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while\nmaintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged."}

However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer\nfrom overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even\nfor simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational\ninefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions\nin batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically\ncompressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource\ncompetition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation\n(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from\nbatch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages\nbatch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model\nto allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to\ninternalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA\nenables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining\nsufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on\na wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate\nthat DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many\ncases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking\nproblem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable\ndeployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into\nfine-grained control of reasoning behaviors."}

Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by\nmeasuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric\ncharacterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in\nscenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian\nframework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when\npresented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and\nirrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives.
