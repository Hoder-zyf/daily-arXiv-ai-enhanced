Recent advances highlight that temporal transaction\nevolution reveals more attack signatures than static graphs. However, current\nmethods either fail to model continuous transaction dynamics or incur high\ncomputational costs that limit scalability to large-scale transaction networks.\nFurthermore, current methods fail to consider two higher-order behavioral\nfingerprints: (1) direction in temporal transaction flows, which encodes money\nmovement trajectories, and (2) account clustering, which reveals coordinated\nbehavior of organized malicious collectives. To address these challenges, we\npropose DiT-SGCR, an unsupervised graph encoder for malicious account\ndetection. Specifically, DiT-SGCR employs directional temporal aggregation to\ncapture dynamic account interactions, then coupled with differentiable\nclustering and graph Laplacian regularization to generate high-quality,\nlow-dimensional embeddings. Our approach simultaneously encodes directional\ntemporal dynamics, global topology, and cluster-specific behavioral patterns,\nthereby enhancing the discriminability and robustness of account\nrepresentations. Furthermore, DiT-SGCR bypasses conventional graph propagation\nmechanisms, yielding significant scalability advantages.

However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time.

In most OD\nmodels, opinions evolve as a consequence of interactions between agents, and\nthe opinion fusion rule defines how those opinions are updated. In consequence,\ndespite being simplistic, OD models provide an explainable and interpretable\nmechanism for understanding the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution.\nUnfortunately, existing OD models mainly focus on explaining the evolution of\n(usually synthetic) opinions towards consensus, fragmentation, or polarization,\nbut they usually fail to analyze scenarios of (real-world) highly oscillating\nopinions. This work overcomes this limitation by studying the ability of\nseveral OD models to reproduce highly oscillating dynamics. To this end, we\nformulate an optimization problem which is further solved using Evolutionary\nAlgorithms, providing both quantitative results on the performance of the\noptimization and qualitative interpretations on the obtained results.

Previous work adopts\nthe split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of\nadmissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often\ncontain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address\nthis, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that\ncalibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer\nper question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical\nerror rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as\nClopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error\nrate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty\nthreshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing\nsample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong\ntest-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency\nunder limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text\ngeneration tasks.

Under review", "summary": "Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural\nlanguage processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still\nencounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving\nlogical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on\nimplicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge\nrepresentation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce\na novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First,\nwe convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating\nreasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),\nincorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common\nSubsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce\ncomputational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust\nperformance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with\noptimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning\nintegration in LLMs."}

The\nsystem generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each\naccompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate\nanalytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.\n  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term\nmemory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific\nanalytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,\nup-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current\nclinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex\ndiagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We\nevaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional\ndiagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013\ndiseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15\nmethods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other\nagentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing\nthe second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79\npercentage points.

Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x\ntimes more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while\nmaintaining higher accuracy.

What makes a base language model\nsuitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question\nis essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next\ngeneration. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL\ndynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our\nstudy reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as\nMegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,\nwhile existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further\nadding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\nexamples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this\neffect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce\nverbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the\nimportance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to\nstronger downstream RL performance.
