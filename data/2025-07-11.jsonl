However, it remains unclear if these differences in\nbiases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training\nstochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to\ndisentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using\ndifferent random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$\ncognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping\ninstruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses\ndatasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases\nare dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases\nin finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond\nfinetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop\nprincipled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs."}

The proposed\nframework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the\nchallenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic,\nand mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The\nproposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the\nSPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal\nreference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a\nreference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered\nvia traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH\nspace via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The\nproposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \\emph{meshless}\nGalerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection\nmodel-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three\nnumerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and\n3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and\npredictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed\nframework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations\nin a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is\nsensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible\nassumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through\nnonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach.

Our\nsecond model demonstrates that established norms influence researchers'\nwillingness to collaborate, with contribution-sensitive norms consistently\noutperforming insensitive alternatives in fostering successful partnerships.\nContribution-insensitive norms create systematic coordination failures through\ntwo mechanisms: \"main contributor resentment\" when exceptional work goes\nunrecognized, and \"second contributor resentment\" when comparable efforts\nreceive unequal credit.

Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold.

Although many\nfine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational\ncost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and\ncomplexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is\nneeded. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by\nstoring external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to\nsupport question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face\nsignificant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper\nintroduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome\nthese limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG\nintegrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text\nsummarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework\nalso includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,\nsignificantly reducing the training time.

Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines\nan implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.\nHowever, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,\ncompared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head\nover the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a\ngeneralization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They\ncan be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and\ndiffer only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding\nof the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate\nthe root cause of this gap.

Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to\nembrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful\nin real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured\nmemory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and\nKnowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls\nand coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,\nreason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We\nvalidate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a\nchallenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution\ncomputer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and\nwhere no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher\naccuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.\nSecond, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual\ninput, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing\nexisting baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance\nstandard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our\nmemory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors\nthe screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers\nintuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy."}

Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines\nan implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.\nHowever, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,\ncompared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head\nover the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a\ngeneralization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They\ncan be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and\ndiffer only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding\nof the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate\nthe root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,\nis that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,\nthey often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,\nas well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against\nalternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge\nthe intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder\nthan verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.\nTaken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can\nsubstantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models."}
