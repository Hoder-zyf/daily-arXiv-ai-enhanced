Molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations are crucial tools for studying atomic-level dynamics. This work\nfocuses on improving the efficiency of MD simulations involving two-body and\nthree-body interactions. Traditional two-body potentials often can not fully\ncapture the complexity of molecular systems, making the inclusion of three-body\ninteractions important. However, these interactions are in a cubic complexity\nclass, compared to a quadratic one for two-body interactions, and therefore are\ncomputationally expensive, even when a cutoff distance is applied. One way to\nimprove efficiency is to use the r-RESPA multiple time-stepping algorithm to\nreduce the number of three-body interaction calculations. In this work, we\ninvestigate this method in the context of High Performance Computing (HPC)\nmethods that parallelize the calculations. In particular, we investigate a\ncommunication-reducing distributed-memory parallel method from literature and\npresent a novel shared-memory parallel cutoff method, implemented in the\nparticle simulation library AutoPas. The results and methods are discussed,\nproviding insights into potential advancements in MD simulation efficiency."}

At predefined timepoints called \"decision points,\"\nintelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions\n(JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey\ndata and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting\nhabitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on\ndelivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur.\nCurrent practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour)\nbefore user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same\nfor all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly\nfor individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after\nthe target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.\nIn this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule\ndecision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior\ntiming is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to\nthe predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling\nschedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely\nintervention.

Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts.

In this work, we propose F2STrans, a\nfunction-to-style guiding paradigm designed to progressively improve the\nperformance of LLMs in code translation. Our approach comprises two key stages:\n(1) Functional learning, which optimizes translation correctness using\nhigh-quality source-target code pairs mined from online programming platforms,\nand (2) Style learning, which improves translation readability by incorporating\nboth positive and negative style examples. Additionally, we introduce a novel\ncode translation benchmark that includes up-to-date source code, extensive test\ncases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations, enabling comprehensive\nfunctional and stylistic evaluations. Experiments on both our new benchmark and\nexisting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves code\ntranslation performance. Notably, our approach enables Qwen-1.5B to outperform\nprompt-enhanced Qwen-32B and GPT-4 on average across 20 diverse code\ntranslation scenarios."}

To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning.

To\naddress this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel\nmeaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)\nframework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja\n(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja\ncandidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual\ndisambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation\nto prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge\nsignificantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\\% relative\nimprovement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment\nbetween Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive\ncross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja\naugmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with\nno additional run-time cost."}

The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for\nthe two-answer forced-choice design.

Human patent experts evaluated the\ntextual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each\nmodel.

How well do these models\nalign with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research\nhas shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack\nrobust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the\ncurrent study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a\nfine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human\nperformance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in\nLLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity\nbetween the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity\nbetween the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the\neffectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we\nexamine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in\nhumans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and\nnot just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our\nexperiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)\nand performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as\nGPT-4 and LLaMA3.

This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory.

We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism).
