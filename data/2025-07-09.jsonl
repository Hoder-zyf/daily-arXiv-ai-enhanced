Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional\nvideo diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by\npartial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a\nSequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse,\nphysics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions.\nThe prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns\nonly the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the\nS-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution\nto its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening\nhigh-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework\nis assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity\nflow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens.

The\nanonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human\nexperts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical\nrubric.\n  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored\npeer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;\np=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th\n(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI\nplans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It\nranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.\n  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally\ndependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by\nhuman experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep\ngap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic\nlogic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,\nsuggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that\nbridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care."}

However, in tasks such\nas text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective\ndomain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of\ninput pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the\nrich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge\ndistillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the\narchitectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by\nreinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder\ngenerates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output\nspace. During training, the encoder produces representations and their\nsimilarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the\nteacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.\nThe MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and\nadaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative\nsamples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing\nthe LLM to achieve improved performance.

After each\naction, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.\nHowever, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning\n(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is\nnon-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in\ncomplex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual\ntargets.\n  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI\nTest-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate\naction proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we\nsample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to\nevaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better\ndecision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and\nimproving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves\nimproved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its\ncorresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning\n(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,\nrewarding successful clicks on interface elements.\n  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse benchmarks.

In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of\nindividually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each\nindividual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain\nthis phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points\nsuffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised\nfinetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled\nexperiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data\ngenerated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even\nsmaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard\n11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the\nperformance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base\nmodel while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta\nlearning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art\npost-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic\nregression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides\nuseful signal for improving a stronger student.

In addition, we introduce a unique\nindicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,\nwhich has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.\nSkywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving\nfrom 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.\nRemarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B\nparameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation\nsuccessfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related\nreasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and\nreinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on\nmultimodal reasoning.

In\nthis work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the\ndomain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training\ndata in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,\nwe present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is\nlinearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of\nmemorizing highly randomized strings, or \"gibberish\", we observe that such\nsequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low\nempirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same\nstrategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective\napproach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference\n(DI)."}

While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these\nintroduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We\nintroduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a\nnew Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six\nlanguages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is\ntrained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and\nhigh-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two\nEnglish-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.\nNeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining\nstrong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.\nNotably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while\noutperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though\nthese models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending\ncrosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously\nassess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,\nNeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We\nrelease an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated\ndataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual\nevaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates\nthat multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved\nrobustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI."}

We\nintroduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs\nacross three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,\nand test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive\nprogramming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent\nsystem across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and\nrobustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift\nbetween model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to\ncluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study\ndemonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and\ndiverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially\nenhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal\nboth the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may\nfacilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential\ndirection for developing more powerful coding models."}

Instructions such as \"GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY\"\nwere concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses\nvaried: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the\npractice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes\nthis practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique\nof prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of\nhidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed\nevaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as \"honeypots\" to detect\nreviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently\nself-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.\nPublishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer\nreview entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure\nrequirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond\npeer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including\nplagiarism detection and citation indexing.

However, their high\ncomputational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies\nevaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as\nlatency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.\nHowever, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\\eg\nparallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,\nmaking it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the\nefficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose\nE\\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per\nPetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for\nhardware-agnostic throughput.

By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution\nlogs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent\nknowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success\nrates by up to 16.28 percentage points.
