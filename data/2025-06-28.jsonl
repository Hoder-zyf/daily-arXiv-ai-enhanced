There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}.

While prior works have optimized models to reason\nover relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between\nuser engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee\nuser engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable\ninteractive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future\ndevelopment of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant\nindicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue\nintention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To\nachieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive\nLLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system\nvia \\textit{i$\\times$MCTS} (\\textit{M}onte \\textit{C}arlo \\textit{T}ree\n\\textit{S}earch for \\textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset\ncontaining pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using\n\\textit{i$\\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user\nengagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments\nconducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support\nconversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively\nenhances user engagement in interactive LLMs."}

Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data\nfiltering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy\ncan be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.\nTherefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM\ntraining."}

This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an\nunderstanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems\npreserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn\nconversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents\nprimarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information\ncan be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158\nreal-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed\nsuch that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet\nunrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then\nevaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of\ncontextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without\nviolating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,\nincluding GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual\nprivacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\\% and 43.6\\% of the\ntime. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in\n59.9\\% and 50.5\\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.\nFurthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\\% of scenarios.\nThese results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both\ncontextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving."}

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence\nindicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw\ninspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by\ngeneral knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that\nincorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal\nreasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly\nenhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and\ncounterfactual contexts.
