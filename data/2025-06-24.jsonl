Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their\nbehaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies\nhave assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.\nHowever, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards\nare at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this\npaper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple\nLLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and\npain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for\nscrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward\napplications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'\nbehalf."}

To that end, we present a model that\nleverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.\nImage Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their\nbias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias\nscore of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting\nbiased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models.

At the same\ntime, concerns about the concentration of power in deployed AI systems have\nsparked a keen interest in 'democratic' or 'public' AI. In this work, we bring\nthese two ideas together by proposing mechanisms for aggregated individual\nreporting (AIR), a framework for post-deployment evaluation that relies on\nindividual reports from the public. An AIR mechanism allows those who interact\nwith a specific, deployed (AI) system to report when they feel that they may\nhave experienced something problematic; these reports are then aggregated over\ntime, with the goal of evaluating the relevant system in a fine-grained manner.\nThis position paper argues that individual experiences should be understood as\nan integral part of post-deployment evaluation, and that the scope of our\nproposed aggregated individual reporting mechanism is a practical path to that\nend. On the one hand, individual reporting can identify substantively novel\ninsights about safety and performance; on the other, aggregation can be\nuniquely useful for informing action.

Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised\nclustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and\nsemantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round\nattention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to\ngenerate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this\npaper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,\nwhich is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic\ndecision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with\nthe existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model\nhas stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and\nheterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log\ndataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which\nis significantly better than the current mainstream methods"}

Secondly, these systems are\nassessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not\nadequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this\npaper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these\nlimitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling\nhuman-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach\ncombines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate\nhierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to\nidentify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths\nusing a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient\noperational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration\nlearning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over\ntime based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization\nand adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state\ntransitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked\nchallenges in current benchmarks.

To address this challenge, we propose\nTyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions\nas auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting.

Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review\nmethodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024\ninvestigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary\nprompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,\nself-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and\nparameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential\nfor reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias\ntypes. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to\nprompt-based mitigation than others.

However, existing\nconversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of\nspecific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models\nwhen encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications.\nTo bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot\nconversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets\nacross two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose\nSITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive\nlearning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot\nsetting.

This multifaceted problem,\nwhich intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and\nformation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in\nlocating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework\n(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),\nwhich delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a\nlow-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.\nSpecifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent\nreinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication\n(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish\nconsensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.\nMeanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal\npolicy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level\ncontrol.

To address this, we propose a single-pass,\ntraining-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled\nrEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that\nhallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal\nrepresentations of input context and its generated output.

Knowing when and how much to trust these models is\ncritical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.\nTo this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this\nwork. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning\nmodels well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model\ncalibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated).

Irrelevant parameters\nin the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the\nLLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our\nframework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME\nsettings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting\nLLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME\nprocess."}

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for\nfuture work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,\nand progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by\ntraining on formal constitutional principles."}

Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to\nquantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static\nneuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a\nC++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across\nprompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a\ngradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:\nper-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering\ndirections, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to\nselect the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably\nbiases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe\nclassification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe\nclassification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For\nLLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted\ninjections at key layers still improve language selection.

With the advent of generative AI,\nhowever, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt\nto maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI.\n  In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call\nfor meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and\nadaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the\ndifficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change\nthe ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed\nstructure of the generative AI value chain.\n  In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the\npast decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to\naddress the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline\nthree recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory\ntargets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern\ngenerative AI."}

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

Researchers often lack the computational\nexpertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas\nplatform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific\ndomains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven\nprogress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy\n(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform\nthat balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data\nacross multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows\nusing customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI\nresearch copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and\nresearch automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools\nof Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate\nscientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research\ncommunity-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole."}

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions.

Based on this, we\npropose ICI with SCM as a \"rung 3\" causal inference, because it involves\n\"imagining\" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on\nan individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts.\nSpecifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent\nthe population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y\n| indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI\nwith SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual\ncounterfactuals (non-actual)."}

Many of these tools\nwere initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and\ntherefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the\nutility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI,\nhowever, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt\nto maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI.\n  In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call\nfor meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and\nadaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the\ndifficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change\nthe ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed\nstructure of the generative AI value chain.\n  In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the\npast decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to\naddress the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline\nthree recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory\ntargets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern\ngenerative AI."}

This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such\nsystems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red\nteaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks\nin complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,\nthey fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities\ncan be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with\neach other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic\nteaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that\ncan happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also\npresent a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of\nscenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety\nof agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,\nan agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has\naccess to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or\ncooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture\nexisting safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context\noptimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework\nto generate better scenarios for safety analysis.

To fill this gap, we propose Action\nSemantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning\nobjective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions.

While recent work in AI safety\nand mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,\nthey often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for\nother technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render\ndifferent alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting\nalignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in\nterms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according\nto which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the\npotential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI\nsystems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a\nhierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control\ncharacteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally\ninteroperable.

However, like previous language models, reasoning\nmodels are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are\nincorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is\ncritical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.\nTo this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this\nwork. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning\nmodels well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model\ncalibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated).

During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be\nnegatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,\nwe propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only\nenhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also\nmitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the\ntriplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of\nLLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge\nin a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we\nselect queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to\ndetermine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters\nin the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the\nLLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data.

This tendency of LMs to\ngenerate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because\nthese fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to\ndetect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most\nrely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased\ncomputational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,\ntraining-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled\nrEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that\nhallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal\nrepresentations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this\ndecoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to\nhidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We\nconduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,\nevaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six\nopen-source LMs of varying scales and properties.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

We provide online leaderboards at\nhttps://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow\ninteractive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such\nas cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance\nin different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to\ninfluence education and help to address the global learning crisis.\nEducation-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to\nunderstand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and\nsupport effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed\nfor informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and\nLLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and\npolicy decisions."}

Knowing when and how much to trust these models is\ncritical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.\nTo this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this\nwork. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning\nmodels well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model\ncalibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated).

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions.
