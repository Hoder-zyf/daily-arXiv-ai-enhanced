Detecting hallucinations has\nquickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty\nestimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency\nchecks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,\nsuch as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth\nnecessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor\nfrom LLM-generated text.

While existing work has focused on static provision and exogenous\nexit strategies, we characterise the optimal exit time as the solution to a\nstochastic control problem with an endogenous stopping time. Mathematically,\nthe LP's value function is shown to satisfy a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\nquasi-variational inequality, for which we establish uniqueness in the\nviscosity sense. To solve the problem numerically, we develop two complementary\napproaches: a Euler scheme based on operator splitting and a Longstaff-Schwartz\nregression method.

The process begins with generating\nslide-level EduKGs from individual pages/slides, which are then merged to form\na comprehensive EduKG representing the entire learning material. We evaluate\nthe accuracy of the EduKG generated from the proposed pipeline in our MOOC\nplatform, CourseMapper. The observed accuracy, while indicative of partial\nsuccess, is relatively low particularly in the educational context, where the\nreliability of knowledge representations is critical for supporting meaningful\nlearning. To address this, we introduce targeted optimizations across multiple\npipeline components. The optimized pipeline achieves a 17.5% improvement in\naccuracy and a tenfold increase in processing efficiency. Our approach offers a\nholistic, scalable and end-to-end pipeline for automatic EduKG construction,\nadaptable to diverse educational contexts, and supports improved semantic\nrepresentation of learning content."}

Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from\nneighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus\non a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents\nMSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that\nintegrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow\nheterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution\nto extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies\nscale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of\nroad networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,\nMSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple\nscales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,\nwhich are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road\nnetwork representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that\nMSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks.

One branch of\nthe law for which AI audits are particularly salient is anti-discrimination\nlaw. Several areas of anti-discrimination law implicate the \"less\ndiscriminatory alternative\" (LDA) requirement, in which a protocol (e.g.,\nmodel) is defensible if no less discriminatory protocol that achieves\ncomparable performance can be found with a reasonable amount of effort.\nNotably, the burden of proving an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant\n(the party alleging discrimination).

Moreover, developers often shield information about and access to\ntheir model and training data as trade secrets, making it difficult to\nreproduce a similar model from scratch.\n  In this work, we present a procedure enabling claimants to determine if an\nLDA exists, even when they have limited compute, data, information, and model\naccess.

Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools\nuniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different\ngeospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution.

We find that, regardless of the length of\nthe biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant\nto a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and\nintegrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire\nbiasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information\nvolume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic\ncorrelation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and\ncalculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate\nrepresentations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,\nphrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled\nto produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information\nacross various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual\nrecognition.

Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior.

Furthermore, it generalizes\neffectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than\ncontained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens\nthan majority voting with larger numbers of solutions."}

Experiments on WN18RR\nand FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance\ncompared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for\nscalable knowledge graph completion."}

This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as\ninput-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true\ncontribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a\nparameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE\nintroduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing\nof attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the\nmagnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,\nthese modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and\nfuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled\npolicy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,\nmaking it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA\nbenchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces\nhallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest\noverhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates\nwith off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world\nsettings."}

We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable\ncontinued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust\nin-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning\nfor broader chat workflows.\n  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural\ncausal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a\nrandom-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM\nto strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a\ntoken-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and\ndelivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.\n  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),\nMachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an\naverage of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across\nfinance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking\nmany-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context\ndemonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it\nattains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat\ncapabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves\n75.4% on MMLU."}

Our\nwork confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving\nresearch into a scalable data engine.

Our pipeline is\nprincipled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for \"interesting\" theorems, and\ngenerate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by\nconstruction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three\ndifficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,\nand proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a\nclear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural\nreasoning.

In this work, we propose COMPACT, which\njointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)\nprunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,\naligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys\nmerits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps\na standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN\npruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong\nmemory savings alongside throughput gains.
