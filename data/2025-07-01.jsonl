Structural models like Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho (SABR) model\noffer interpretability and theoretical consistency but lack flexibility, while\npurely data-driven methods such as Gaussian Process regression can struggle\nwith sparse data. We introduce SABR-Informed Multi-Task Gaussian Process\n(SABR-MTGP), treating IVS construction as a multi-task learning problem. Our\nmethod uses a dense synthetic dataset from a calibrated SABR model as a source\ntask to inform the construction based on sparse market data (the target task).\nThe MTGP framework captures task correlation and transfers structural\ninformation adaptively, improving predictions particularly in data-scarce\nregions. Experiments using Heston-generated ground truth data under various\nmarket conditions show that SABR-MTGP outperforms both standard Gaussian\nprocess regression and SABR across different maturities. Furthermore, an\napplication to real SPX market data demonstrates the method's practical\napplicability and its ability to produce stable and realistic surfaces. This\nconfirms our method balances structural guidance from SABR with the flexibility\nneeded for market data."}

We argue that viewing AI as a simple reduction in input\ncosts overlooks two critical dynamics: (a) the inherent trade-offs among\ngenerality, accuracy, and simplicity, and (b) the redistribution of complexity\nacross stakeholders. While LLMs appear to defy the traditional trade-off by\noffering high generality and accuracy through simple interfaces, this\nuser-facing simplicity masks a significant shift of complexity to\ninfrastructure, compliance, and specialized personnel. The GAS trade-off,\ntherefore, does not disappear but is relocated from the user to the\norganization, creating new managerial challenges, particularly around accuracy\nin high-stakes applications. We contend that competitive advantage no longer\nstems from mere AI adoption, but from mastering this redistributed complexity\nthrough the design of abstraction layers, workflow alignment, and complementary\nexpertise.

For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with\nobjective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other\nlanguage features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,\nconcreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to\nwhich we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.\nThose features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,\nconducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands\nof words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human\nratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover\nmany different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we\nevaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on\ntwo psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets\ncover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that\nalignment is \\textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated\n(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and\ngender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,\nolfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation\nof current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which\nmay be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and\nillustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets."}

This study finds that GPT-4 is\ncapable of high-level policy analysis, with limitations including a lack of\nreliable attribution, and can also enable more nuanced analysis by researchers.\nIts use in this research shows that councils which have passed a CED are more\nlikely to have a recent and climate-specific policy, and show more attention to\nurgency, prioritisation, and equity and social justice, than councils which\nhave not. It concludes that the ability to assess policy documents at scale\nopens up exciting new opportunities for policy researchers."}

Finally, we\napply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal\nadversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.\nExperiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both\nanonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight\ndesign supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and\ncommunication-based privacy risks.

While other technologies may also pose substantial\nrisks, AI's pervasive reach makes its societal effects especially profound. The\ncomplexity of AI systems, coupled with their remarkable capabilities, can lead\nto a reliance on technologies that operate beyond direct human oversight or\nunderstanding. To mitigate the risks that arise, several theoretical tools and\nguidelines have been developed, alongside efforts to create technological tools\naimed at safeguarding Trustworthy AI. The guidelines take a more holistic view\nof the issue but fail to provide techniques for quantifying trustworthiness.\nConversely, while technological tools are better at achieving such\nquantification, they lack a holistic perspective, focusing instead on specific\naspects of Trustworthy AI. This paper aims to introduce an assessment method\nthat combines the ethical components of Trustworthy AI with the algorithmic\nprocesses of PageRank and TrustRank.

Compared to\nclassic periodic truss-, beam- and plate-based lattice architectures,\nspinodoids are insensitive to manufacturing defects, scalable for high\nthroughput production, functionally graded by tunable local properties, and\nmaterial failure resistant due to low-curvature morphology. However, the design\nof spinodoids is often hindered by the curse of dimensionality with extremely\nlarge design space of spinodoid types, material density, orientation,\ncontinuity, and anisotropy. From a design optimization perspective, while\ngenetic algorithms are often beyond the reach of computing capacity,\ngradient-based topology optimization is challenged by the intricate\nmathematical derivation of gradient fields with respect to various spinodoid\nparameters. To address such challenges, we propose a data-driven multiscale\ntopology optimization framework. Our framework reformulates the design\nvariables of spinodoid materials as the parameters of neural networks, enabling\nautomated computation of topological gradients. Additionally, it incorporates a\nGaussian Process surrogate for spinodoid constitutive models, eliminating the\nneed for repeated computational homogenization and enhancing the scalability of\nmultiscale topology optimization.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,\nto mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in\nmemory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain\nonly a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the\nvocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting\nslightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting\nlatency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,\nresulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can\nboost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically\nby 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct."}

These mobility embeddings define a functional distance between places,\none that reflects behavioral rather than physical proximity, and allow us to\ndetect barriers between neighborhoods that are geographically close but\nbehaviorally disconnected. We find that the strongest predictors of these\nbarriers are differences in access to amenities, administrative borders, and\nresidential segregation by income and race. These invisible borders are\nconcentrated in urban cores and persist across cities, spatial scales, and time\nperiods. Physical infrastructure, such as highways and parks, plays a secondary\nbut still significant role, especially at short distances.

Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly\nrestrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention\nas an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data\nposes unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that\nprevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an\ninnovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically\nsignificant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and\nemotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data\naugmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity\nscenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.\nThe thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:\nLinguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and\nAugmented Content Misinterpretation.\n  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting\ndata in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,\ninterdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and\nsocial science methodology."}

Experiment results show\nthat KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,\nparticularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this\npaper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea."}

We prove that this endogenous reward is not a\nheuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through\noffline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly\nelicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised\nfine-tuned) model without any further training.

At its core is a hierarchical\nHopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic\ntokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or\nsupervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences\nas multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form\nof plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to\ngeneralize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We\ndemonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds\ndistributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding.

We\nintroduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned\nLLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component.

Motivated by this finding\nand our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the\nratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training\ncomponent. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs\ncircumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is\nconsistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those\nwhere they do not.

The\nworkshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language\nmodels (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of\nLLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language\nunderstanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to\noffer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between\nLLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with\nhuman feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI\ncollaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report\naims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in\ncognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance\nof ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving\nto enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through\neffective human-AI collaboration."}

To evaluate VFT, we subsequently\ntrain models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which\nincorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack\nby exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models\nexploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained\nmodel's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we\nperform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;\nwith a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT\nachieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the\ninfluence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while\nbaselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%).

Among the\ninsights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the\nthird quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always\nsymmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default\nmodels; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for\nsome LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge\ndistillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from\ntrue and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable\nmethod for verifying what LLMs \"know\" and how certain they are of their\nprobabilistic internal knowledge."}

At its core is a hierarchical\nHopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic\ntokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or\nsupervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences\nas multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form\nof plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to\ngeneralize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We\ndemonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds\ndistributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding.

This study finds that GPT-4 is\ncapable of high-level policy analysis, with limitations including a lack of\nreliable attribution, and can also enable more nuanced analysis by researchers.\nIts use in this research shows that councils which have passed a CED are more\nlikely to have a recent and climate-specific policy, and show more attention to\nurgency, prioritisation, and equity and social justice, than councils which\nhave not. It concludes that the ability to assess policy documents at scale\nopens up exciting new opportunities for policy researchers."}

To fill this gap, we\nintroduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively\nevaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,\nchallenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring\nmulti-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple\ndifficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from\nfoundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated\ninto an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to\neliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust\nreasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed\nstep-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism\nto reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark\npopular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning\ncapabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing\nMLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/HJYao00/MMReason."}

However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and\nlack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable\nAudits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to\nverify interaction with a compliant AI model. Our work protects sensitive data\neven when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses\nverification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks.

We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework\nwhere models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously\nimproving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.\nThrough self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively\nchallenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These\nresults demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable\nreasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous\nreasoning development."}
