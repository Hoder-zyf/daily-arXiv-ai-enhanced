The preservation of\nbiodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the\nsustainability of ecosystems.

Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local\nand global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and\nconservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation\nModels (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by\nleveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to\nvarious downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity\nconservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model\ntailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning. BioAnalyst\nemploys a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multi-modal\ndatasets encompassing species occurrence records, remote sensing indicators,\nclimate and environmental variables. BioAnalyst is designed for adaptability,\nallowing for fine-tuning of a range of downstream tasks, such as species\ndistribution modelling, habitat suitability assessments, invasive species\ndetection, and population trend forecasting. We evaluate the model's\nperformance on two downstream use cases, demonstrating its generalisability\ncompared to existing methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios for two\ndistinct use-cases, establishing a new accuracy baseline for ecological\nforecasting.

This gap remains unaddressed as an engineer's\ndecision-making process, typically governed by professional ethics and\npractical guidelines, now intersects with complex algorithmic outputs. To\nbridge this gap, this paper explores how engineers can navigate legal\nprinciples and legislative justifications that support and/or contest the\ndeployment of ML technologies. Drawing on recent precedents and experiences\ngained from other fields, this paper argues that analogical reasoning can\nprovide a basis for embedding ML within existing engineering codes while\nmaintaining professional accountability and meeting safety requirements. In\nexploring these issues, the discussion focuses on established liability\ndoctrines, such as negligence and product liability, and highlights how courts\nhave evaluated the use of predictive models. We further analyze how legislative\nbodies and standard-setting organizations can furnish explicit guidance\nequivalent to prior endorsements of emergent technologies.

However, due\nto limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to\ndetect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we\nintroduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for\npartially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection.

To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation\nframework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive\nlearning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of\nsarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor\noutputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation\nquality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate\nViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including\nlarge language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.\nFurthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual\nIncongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts\nexhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity\n(0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic\ncontent than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly\navailable.

Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned.

Simulation results\nconfirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines."}

To address\nthis, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner\nmechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input\nqueries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,\nwe present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures\nthe substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further\nvalidate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across\nlayers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of\nTransformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the\nconcept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite\npatterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully\nextract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.\nTogether, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers\nperform the substructure extraction task over graph data."}

In this survey, we\nprovide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in concise and adaptive\nthinking for efficient reasoning of LRMs, including methodologies, benchmarks,\nand challenges for future exploration.

We present a new corpus that\ncombines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for\nreference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications\n-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to\nexperiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this\ncorpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification\nquestions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We\nfind that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing\nclarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans\nand LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential\nambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce\nmore clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task\nuncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is\npredicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with\ndifferent reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase\nquestion frequency and relevancy."}

Intentionality and context are both central to the\nscope of Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime, used as an effective\nTiny Language Model. One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low\nlevel (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence\nas a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent\n`intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and\nassessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort\nparts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime\ncoherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation\nof latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference\nto extensive training or reasoning capabilities. The process is well within the\nreach of basic organisms as it does not require large scale artificial\nprobabilistic batch processing.

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise\ncomparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining\ncomments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved\njudge performance."}
