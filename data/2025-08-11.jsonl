In this study, we\nintroduce a mathematical framework based on higher-order network models to\nevaluate the representativeness of benchmark networks, focusing on the widely\nused Sioux Falls scenario. Higher-order network models encode empirical and\nsimulated trajectory data into memory-aware network representations, which we\nuse to quantify sequential dependencies in mobility behavior and assess how\nwell benchmark networks capture real-world structural and functional patterns.\nApplying this framework to the Sioux Falls network, as well as real-world\ntrajectory data, we quantify structural complexity, optimal memory length, link\nprediction accuracy, and centrality alignment. Our results show and\nstatistically quantify that the classical Sioux Falls network exhibits limited\npath diversity, rapid structural fragmentation at higher orders, and weak\nalignment with empirical routing behavior.

First, an Ecological\nIntensification (EI) model determines the economically optimal allocation of\nland to margin and habitat interventions at the individual farm level. These\nfarm-specific intervention levels are then passed to an Ecological Connectivity\n(EC) model, which spatially arranges them across the landscape to maximize\nconnectivity while preserving farm-level profitability.

We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that\nenables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while\nminimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the\nbest LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled\nexamples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review\nhigh-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and\nexpand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like\nprosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition\nalignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train\na two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence\npredictions, while only $\\sim$35\\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to\nGPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\\sim$70% while achieving\nhigh precision ($\\sim$0.90).

Thus,there is a gap between what we want Fair ML to\nachieve and what it does in a dynamic social environment. Hence, we propose an\nalternative dynamic mechanism,\"Fair Game\",to assure fairness in the predictions\nof an ML algorithm and to adapt its predictions as the society interacts with\nthe algorithm over time. \"Fair Game\" puts together an Auditor and a Debiasing\nalgorithm in a loop around an ML algorithm.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters.

However, existing methods face a\ndilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor\nadaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the\nrigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address\nthis, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework.\nGrounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes\nscore-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To\nensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing\nmulti-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the\nevaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide\nthe story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks\nincluding StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters.

As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance.

HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in\ninterpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a\nBLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated\ncaptions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF\nyielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating\nstronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the\npotential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data."}

Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as\nthe memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates\nand greater efficiency on analogous tasks.

Their adaptability raises the question of\nwhether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer\nto unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we\nfine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or\nmultilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter\nacross 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific\ndiscourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables\ncross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects\npre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,\nidentifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance\nbenefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant\nlanguages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during\nfine-tuning (as little as $9.62\\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training\ntoken volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption\nthat cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited\nlanguage coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural\nbiases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing\n4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,\nreproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster\ninference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,\nenabling scalable, inclusive research."}

A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding\nnatural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which\naccurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a\ncorrect semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally\nappropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address\nthis exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization\n(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer\ngeneration strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a\ntheoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from\nfirst principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B\nand InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple\nchallenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative\nimprovements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks\ndesigned to test generalization and semantic understanding.
