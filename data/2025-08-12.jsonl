Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like\naccuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation\nreveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant\ndegradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free\ninference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is\noften much smaller than expected. These findings pave way for simpler and\npotentially more privacy-preserving tokenization schemes that do not\ncatastrophically compromise model performance."}

Existing research on interoperability predominantly focuses either\non technological interoperability itself or on the legal regulations concerning\ninteroperability, with insufficient exploration of their interdisciplinary\nintersection. This paper compares the technological interoperability in Web 3.0\nwith the theoretical framework of legal interoperability established by the EU\nData Act, analysing the areas of convergence and mismatch. The goal is to align\ntechnical interoperability with legal concepts of interoperability, thereby\nenhancing the practical implementation of systematic interoperability in the\nnext generation of the Web. This study finds that, firstly, Web 3.0's concept\nof interoperability spans data, systems, and applications, while the Data Act\nfocuses solely on data. This narrow scope risks creating a fragmented\necosystem, where data exchange is possible, but full integration of systems and\napplications is hindered, leading to inefficiencies, and obstructing seamless\ndata flow across platforms. Secondly, while Web 3.0 technically seeks to\nachieve interoperability through the integration of entire systems and\ndecentralised applications, the compliance with Data Act might negatively limit\nsuch system and application interoperability through its data interoperability\nprovisions. This paper suggests interdisciplinary recommendations to enhance\nthe implementation and enforcement of interoperability. On one hand, the Data\nAct should broaden its concept of interoperability to encompass both the\nsystems and applications layers. On the other hand, it is advisable to\nintroduce provisions for standardised protocols through soft law mechanisms to\naddress legal shortcomings and keep pace with technological advancements."}

Our work seeks to bridge this gap by firstly conducting a\nsystematic analysis of worker actions at Google and Microsoft reported in U.S.\nnewspapers to delineate their characteristics. We then situate these actions\nwithin the long history of labour movements and demonstrate that, despite\nperceptions of radicalism, contemporary tech activism is comparatively\nmoderate. Finally, we engage directly with current and former tech activists to\nprovide a novel catalogue of potential worker actions, evaluating their\nperceived risks, impacts, and effectiveness (concurrently publishing \"Tech\nWorkers' Guide to Resistance\"). Our findings highlight considerable variation\nin strategic thinking among activists themselves. We conclude by arguing that\nthe establishment of a radical flank could increase the effectiveness of\ncurrent movements.\n  \"Tech Workers' Guide to Resistance\" can be found at\nhttps://www.cs.toronto.edu/~msa/TechWorkersResistanceGuide.pdf or\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16779082"}

Our framework spans both\nunderstanding and reasoning task types, defines a three-dimensional metric\nsuite (reliability, generality, and locality), and supports cross-paradigm\ncomparisons across general and domain-specific models. We conduct extensive\nexperiments under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings. Results suggest\nthat current methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning,\nparticularly in complex clinical workflows. We further present an efficiency\nanalysis (e.g., edit latency, memory footprint), revealing practical trade-offs\nin real-world deployment across KE paradigms. Overall, MultiMedEdit not only\nreveals the limitations of current approaches but also provides a solid\nfoundation for developing clinically robust knowledge editing techniques in the\nfuture."}

Current methods, while optimizing for high temporal\nIntersection-over-Union (IoU), often overfit to this metric, compromising\nsemantic action understanding in the video and query, a critical factor for\nrobust TVG. To address this, we introduce Inversion Tasks for TVG (Invert4TVG),\na novel framework that enhances both localization accuracy and action\nunderstanding without additional data. Our approach leverages three inversion\ntasks derived from existing TVG annotations: (1) Verb Completion, predicting\nmasked action verbs in queries from video segments; (2) Action Recognition,\nidentifying query-described actions; and (3) Video Description, generating\ndescriptions of video segments that explicitly embed query-relevant actions.\nThese tasks, integrated with TVG via a reinforcement learning framework with\nwell-designed reward functions, ensure balanced optimization of localization\nand semantics.

To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer.

While RL\ndrives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)\nshows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it\nmerely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from\nclassroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the\nstudent try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the\nmind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model.

This study is the first to reveal that\nstrategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring\nmathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of\nstylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we\nformalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,\nReciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical\nresponses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads\nLLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on\naverage, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably,\nincreasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability.\nFurther analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques\namplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover,\nthe persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting\na critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need\nfor robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks."}

To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded\nin authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through\na three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states;\n(2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation,\nstimulating proper reflections.

Specifically, we first introduce a unified\nconceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of\nself-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:\nSystem Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a\nfoundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this\nframework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques\nthat target different components of the agent system. We also investigate\ndomain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as\nbiomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are\ntightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated\ndiscussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for\nself-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their\neffectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and\npractitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,\nlaying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and\nlifelong agentic systems."}

A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures.
