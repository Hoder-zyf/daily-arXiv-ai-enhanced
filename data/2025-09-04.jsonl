A Game Theoretical Analysis", "comment": "10 Pages, 7 Figures, accepted in the ALIFE 2025 Conference", "summary": "When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide\nbetween profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.\nUntrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative\nconsequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation\ncaused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We\nexplore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the\nproduction of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We\ncreated artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and\nstudied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal\nthat media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but\nnot always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information\nprovided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either\naccessing media or ensuring safety are too high.

In this\npaper, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of the use of computational\napproaches as part of a critical research agenda. Presenting and reflecting\nupon two examples of projects that use computational methods in education to\nexplore questions of equity and justice, we suggest that such approaches might\nhelp expand the capacity of critical researchers to highlight existing\ninequalities, make visible possible approaches for beginning to address such\ninequalities, and engage marginalised communities in designing and ultimately\ndeploying these possibilities. Drawing upon work within the fields of Critical\nData Studies and Science and Technology Studies, we further reflect on the two\ncases to discuss the possibilities and challenges of reimagining computational\nmethods for critical research in education and technology, focusing on six\nareas of consideration: criticality, philosophy, inclusivity, context,\nclassification, and responsibility."}

By orchestrating multiple\nspecialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer\ngenerators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any\nhuman intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across\ndiverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware\nqueries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses\nand feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous\nlearning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model\nupdates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover,\nwe set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question\ngeneration at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release\nAraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page\nchallenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving\nworkflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the\nlong-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language\nModels (LVLMs).

We argue\nthat this gap reflects paradigmatic lock-in that channels AI into incremental\noptimization rather than structural transformation. Using a cross-case\nanalysis, we propose a 2x2 framework that reconceptualizes AI strategy along\ntwo independent dimensions: the degree of transformation achieved (incremental\nto transformational) and the treatment of human contribution (reduced to\namplified). The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice:\nindividual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less\ndeployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first\nthree reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable\nvalue capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:\ncomplementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution\n(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human\ndetermination of ethical and strategic parameters). Complementarity and\nboundary-setting are observable in regulated and high-stakes domains;\nco-evolution is largely absent, which helps explain limited system-level\nimpact. A case study analysis illustrates that advancing toward collaborative\nintelligence requires material restructuring of roles, governance, and data\narchitecture rather than additional tools. The framework reframes AI\ntransformation as an organizational design challenge: moving from optimizing\nthe division of labor between humans and machines to architecting their\nconvergence, with implications for operating models, workforce development, and\nthe future of work."}

The\nsystem is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by\nfinetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model\ninstead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts\ndiscrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the\nparameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including\nlateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and\nlongitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,\ncontinuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently\ninterpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in\noutput size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a\nstate-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating\nperformance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant\nadvantages in explainability and resource efficiency."}

These tasks involve free-text\nannotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives\n(e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether\nLLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is\nchallenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of\nsimilarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable\nevaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied\ntask, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing\nexpert similarity ratings via a \"pick-the-odd-one-out\" triplet judgment task,\nand (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones\n(topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human\nbenchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets\n(interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based\nmetrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful\nto experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with\nexpert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and\nvector-based metrics.

The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice:\nindividual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less\ndeployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first\nthree reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable\nvalue capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:\ncomplementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution\n(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human\ndetermination of ethical and strategic parameters).

Twofold goals are examined; to understand the\nmechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay\nbetween the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.\nThe following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)\nincreased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over\nall tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which\nincreased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened\nalong the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance\nconsiderably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,\nhigher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though\nthe learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.\nThese pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy\nalong the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction\nconfidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input\nmeaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match\ntokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image\nclassification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in\nfine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality.
