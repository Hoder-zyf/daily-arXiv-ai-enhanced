To address the\nsubstantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs\nlow-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This\napproach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an\nadvanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value\nDecomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has\nnever been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance\nresolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate\nsignificant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR\ntechniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance,\nin a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can\nachieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a\nlow Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the\nhigh-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of\nthe EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on\nlimited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the\npotential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications,\nparticularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields.\nIts ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes\nit suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental\nmonitoring or aerospace."}

In this\nwork, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts\nis decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a\ngreat deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,\nacross models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country\ncan be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.\nSurprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)\nsometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of\nrevealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the\ninternal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs\nthrough instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not\nmerely \"leftover\" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we\nfind that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise\ncomparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with\nsuppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other\ndownstream tasks.

We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments.

Importantly, we show that this information is not\nmerely \"leftover\" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we\nfind that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise\ncomparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with\nsuppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other\ndownstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not\nwholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation\nspace-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly\naccessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior."}

It employs\nthree specialized agents, namely, Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader, to\ncollaboratively produce translations for high accuracy in legal meaning,\nappropriateness in style, and adequate coherence and cohesion in structure.\nThis framework supports customizable LLM configurations and achieves tremendous\ncost reduction compared to professional human translation services. We\nevaluated its performance using 13 open-source and commercial LLMs as agents\nand obtained interesting findings, including that it surpasses GPT-4o in legal\nsemantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, yet trails\nhuman experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness.\nOur platform website is available at CityUHK, and our bilingual judgment corpus\nused for the evaluation is available at Hugging Face."}

Stylometry has been\nused extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.\nBy applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing\npatterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,\nwith (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs\n(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text\nsummarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods\n(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models\n(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and\nn-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,\ngrammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results\nreached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the\nmulticlass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary\nclassification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up\nto .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed\nfeatures characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused\nwords, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to\nhuman-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the\nincreasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-\nfrom human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type."}

However, moral\nself-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite\nempirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of\nself-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.\nSecond, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of\ntheir output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency\nduring their self-correction process.

We demonstrate that moral\nself-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic\nshortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during\nself-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both\nself-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly.

While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked\nLanguage Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models\npretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as\nencoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation\nbenchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent\nadvantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model\nand data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of\nlarge-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30\nmodels ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over\n15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM\ngenerally yields better performance across text representation tasks,\nCLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning\nstability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic\ntraining strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal\nperformance under a fixed computational training budget.
