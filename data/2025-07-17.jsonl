Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into\nEnglish and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent\nsessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed\nsignificant variations in evaluation consistency ({\\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to\n0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance\nacross stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming\ndistinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session\nwithin-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically\nminimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped\nby RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that\nLLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human\ncritical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers."}

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering).

To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation.

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods.

To address these limitations, we reconceptualise an\nexisting course-wide engagement metric to create a chapter-based version that\naligns with the weekly structure of online courses. Derived directly from\nvirtual learning environment log data, the new metric allows for cumulative,\nreal-time tracking of student activity without requiring outcome data or model\ntraining. We evaluate the approach across three undergraduate statistics\nmodules over two academic years, comparing it to the course-wide formulation to\nassess how the reconceptualisation influences what is measured. Results\nindicate strong alignment from as early as week 3, along with comparable or\nimproved predictive validity for final grades in structured, lecture-based\ncontexts. By the course midpoint, the weekly metric identifies as many\nlow-performing students as are identifiable by the end of the course.

To address these issues, we propose\na notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and\ncorresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to\nassist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM.

The performance of our PoT\npost-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer\nquantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats.

When it comes to evaluating long\ntexts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length\nand do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when\nco-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,\nwe first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality\nCoreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this\npipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with\nan average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series\nof experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and\ndemonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document\ncoreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full\nbooks. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this\nunprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to\ndeliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents.

This\nmethod not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization\nbut also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs\nfor VHDL."}

This study reveals a\ngender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a\nperception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese\nand Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified\nas AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic\nanalysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly\nassociated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant\nnegative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a\nsignificant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role\nof gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of\naddressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for\nfurther research to validate model performance across different linguistic\ncontexts."}

However, they face challenges such as\nambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this\npaper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to\nenhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The\nframework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and\nMistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate\nframework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B\nvariants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving\na notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex\nambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model\nresponses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate\nframework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities.

Recent advancements,\nhowever, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time\ninformation retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While\nprior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,\ntheir capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains\nunexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic\nattributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic\ndataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international\nparticipants, we show that these models can access social media content and\npredict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic\ndataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,\nwhich may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal\nactivity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science\nin the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information\noperations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We\nrecommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing\napplications, while preserving controlled access for verified research\npurposes."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity.

We evaluate a range of monitoring\napproaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text\nclassifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple\nlinear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all\ntext-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or\nunsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,\nwhile model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive\nsignal.

In practice, these\ntargets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers\ndevelop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then\nrefine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make\nthis optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of\nbenchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms\nbaselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models\nrequire less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly\nmatching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities\nand highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale."}

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%."}
