We formulate the trade execution\nproblem as a dynamic allocation task whose objective is the optimal placement\nof market and limit orders to maximize expected revenue. By employing\nmultivariate logistic-normal distributions to model random allocations, the\nframework enables efficient training of the reinforcement learning algorithm.\nNumerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms traditional\nbenchmark strategies in simulated limit order book environments featuring noise\ntraders submitting random orders, tactical traders responding to order book\nimbalances, and a strategic trader seeking to acquire or liquidate an asset\nposition."}

CMVs account for numerous traffic incidents, so monitoring CMV\nsafety and safety inspections is essential for ensuring safe and efficient\nhighway movement. This paper presents the development and real-world\napplication of CMV dashboards designed under the guidance of CMV safety\nenforcement professionals from the Maryland State Police (MSP), the Maryland\nDepartment of Transportation - State Highway Administration (MDOT - SHA), and\nthe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to enable intuitive and\nefficient analysis of CMV safety performance measures. First, three CMV safety\ndashboards enable CMV safety professionals to identify sites with a history of\nsafety performance issues. A supplemental dashboard automates the analysis of\nCMV enforcement initiatives using the same performance measures. These\nperformance measures are based on CMV probe vehicle speeds, inspection/citation\ndata from Truck Weigh and Inspection Stations (TWIS), patrolling enforcement,\nand Virtual Weigh Stations (VWS). The authors collaborated with MSP to identify\na portion of I-81 in Maryland, susceptible to improvement from targeted CMV\nenforcement. The supplemental enforcement assessment dashboard was employed to\nevaluate the impact of enforcement, including the post-enforcement halo effect.\nThe results of the post-enforcement evaluation were mixed, indicating a need\nfor more fine-grained citation data."}

This principle can be violated in two ways: by designing an artificial\nsystem that elicits stronger or weaker emotional reactions than its capacities\nand moral status warrant (overshooting or undershooting), or by designing a\nsystem that elicits the wrong type of emotional reaction (hitting the wrong\ntarget). Although presumably attractive, practical implementation faces several\nchallenges including: How can we respect user autonomy while promoting\nappropriate responses? How should we navigate expert and public disagreement\nand uncertainty about facts and values? What if emotional alignment seems to\nrequire creating or destroying entities with moral status? To what extent\nshould designs conform to versus attempt to alter user assumptions and\nattitudes?"}

Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of\nhigh-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings\noffer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and\noperations across the joint force."}

Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of\nmultilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and\nlinguistically contextualized model safety evaluations."}

Such abilities can enhance the realism of\nmodels. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the\nepistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards,\nare too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be\nconsistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically\ndemanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that\nconverts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core\ndilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and\nabstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding\nundermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like\ninstructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the\ntension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the\nchallenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become\nobscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents\ntowards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social\nmechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour.\nThis exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure,\nrather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the\nconditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence\nis not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions\nunfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than\nlong-term behavioural evolution.

In this paper, we attempt to make the\ncase that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is\npaved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded\nsemantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional\nlanguage models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within\ninteractive dialogue settings.

We answer an\nopen problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are\nstrictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known\nto be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems.

In this work, we propose\nPERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for\nlearning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight\nmodel adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization\nloops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a\nlow-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for\nthe base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter\nto accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long\ncontext. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK\nsignificantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,\nachieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models\n(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B.

Such abilities can enhance the realism of\nmodels. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the\nepistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards,\nare too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be\nconsistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically\ndemanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that\nconverts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core\ndilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and\nabstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding\nundermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like\ninstructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the\ntension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the\nchallenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become\nobscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents\ntowards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social\nmechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour.\nThis exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure,\nrather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the\nconditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence\nis not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions\nunfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than\nlong-term behavioural evolution.

This work reveals that the visual\ngrounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce\nvulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack\ntargeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when\ngiven correct task-solving plans.

However, their close integration with personal devices\nraises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor\nattacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual\ngrounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce\nvulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack\ntargeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when\ngiven correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose\nVisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to\nlocate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.\nVisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and\ndoes so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical\nfeasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can\neffectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and\nhighly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack\ncan be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,\nthe injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,\ne.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor\nattack risks in GUI agents."}
