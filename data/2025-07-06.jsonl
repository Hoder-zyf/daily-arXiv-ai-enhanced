Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,\nrequiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously\nadapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is\nparticularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward\noutcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers.

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination.

While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the\nsame instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation\nframeworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a\npopular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in\ntraining ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying\nassumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this\npaper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,\nhighlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and\nnoise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have\naddressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual\nframework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance\nselection, annotator choice, and label representation.

Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,\nour findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently\nimprove dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone\nto verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to\ntheir non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and\ndetailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may\nfail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our\nwork provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and\nhighlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for\nreal-world dialogue summarization."}

However, in\nstandard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in\nnatural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To\ncapture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have\nexplored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent\nspace, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether\nsuch reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer\nthat reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We\nexamine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of\nprobing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens.

To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction\nBench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled\nerror injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an\naverage 64.5% blind spot rate.

The emergence of reasoning-capable\nmodels has further widened the cost gap between \"thinking\" (high reasoning) and\n\"non-thinking\" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that\napproximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the\nnon-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.\nThis highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that\ndynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could\noptimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,\nwe further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing\nframework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or\nnon-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets\ndemonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.\n0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by\n36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis\nindicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays\nand even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.\nFinally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index\nto comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token\ncost."}

Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed.

To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach.
