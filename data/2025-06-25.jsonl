Insights from Uplift Modeling on Financial Health", "comment": null, "summary": "Uplift modeling has achieved significant success in various fields,\nparticularly in online marketing. It is a method that primarily utilizes\nmachine learning and deep learning to estimate individual treatment effects.\nThis paper we apply uplift modeling to analyze the effect of company adjustment\non their financial status, and we treat these adjustment as treatments or\ninterventions in this study. Although there have been extensive studies and\napplication regarding binary treatments, multiple treatments, and continuous\ntreatments, company adjustment are often more complex than these scenarios, as\nthey constitute a series of multiple time-dependent actions. The effect\nestimation of company adjustment needs to take into account not only individual\ntreatment traits but also the temporal order of this series of treatments. This\nstudy collects a real-world data set about company financial statements and\nreported behavior in Luxembourg for the experiments. First, we use two\nmeta-learners and three other well-known uplift models to analyze different\ncompany adjustment by simplifying the adjustment as binary treatments.\nFurthermore, we propose a new uplift modeling framework (MTDnet) to address the\ntime-dependent nature of these adjustment, and the experimental result shows\nthe necessity of considering the timing of these adjustment."}

This limitation arises from two key factors: (1) medical\nimages exhibit extensive anatomical variation and low contrast, necessitating a\nlarge receptive field to capture critical features, and (2) existing PEFT\nmethods do not explicitly address the enhancement of receptive fields. To\novercome these challenges, we propose the Large Kernel Adapter (LKA), designed\nto expand the receptive field while maintaining parameter efficiency. The\nproposed LKA consists of three key components: down-projection, channel-wise\nlarge kernel convolution, and up-projection. Through extensive experiments on\nvarious datasets and pre-trained models, we demonstrate that the incorporation\nof a larger kernel size is pivotal in enhancing the adaptation of pre-trained\nmodels for medical image analysis.

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive\ngranular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original\ngraph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal\ngranularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as\nsupernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening\nmethods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to\nhundreds of times and has lower time complexity.

Drawing on the\nintuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model\nresponses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether\nefficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To\nsystematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to\nmeasure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across\ntask settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned\nbehavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and\nself-explanations (IR-SE).

Using clear\nanalogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate\nthese distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise\nresearch directions, fostering effective cross-disciplinary collaboration,\nenhancing policy effectiveness, and ultimately, promoting the deployment of\ntrustworthy AI systems."}

ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to\nlong-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length.

We find that bidirectional RA layers can match\nthe accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a\nstrong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are\njust as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training\nparadigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than\nLCA with 44% higher throughput.

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''\nthat lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for\nsimulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:\nalignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency\n(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness\n(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for\ndetermining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science\nunderstanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when\nfocusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)\nagent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited\nvariance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation\nrobustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in\ndetermining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for\nautomatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on\npredicting the majority-voted \"ground truth\" labels. It is still unclear,\nhowever, whether these models also capture informative human annotation\nvariation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability\nto predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.\nOur results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be\noverlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style\n(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM\nperformance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction.

While\nReinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its\noutcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the\nthinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address\nthe high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced\nRL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by\nintegrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL\ntraining process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL\nguides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality\nreward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping\nthem recognize their knowledge boundaries.

This article provides a comprehensive\nreview of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher\neducation, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We\nsynthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of\nconversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural\nlearning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic\nmethod, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting\nstrategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors\nwith these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive\nlearning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where\nLLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it\nchallenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps\nin applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency\nto provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,\nand the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human\nexpertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better\nalign LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts\nthat encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student\nreflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and\ncontextual relevance.
